## Conclusion

In this project, we developed a deep learning model to classify fish species using the Large Scale Fish Dataset. We performed the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing and exploration
2. Model development using Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Hyperparameter optimization

This project showcases the application of deep learning techniques in image classification tasks and provides a foundation for further research in marine biology and fisheries management.
